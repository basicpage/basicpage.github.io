# basicpage.github.io

Template for a really basic academic page.
In the style of
[academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)
but producing something much simpler.

## Getting started

- [Create a Github account if you don't have one.](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
- Click on [Use this template](https://github.com/new?owner=basicpage&template_name=basicpage.github.io&template_owner=basicpage)
  and then create a new repository called `[your username].github.io`, a bit
  like this repo is called `basicpage.github.io`. This will also be the address
  of your website.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have Github Pro (which you can get with the students programme)
> then your repository must be public for it to work.

- Now go to "Settings" then click "Pages" on the left and select
  "Github Actions" instead of "Deploy from a branch" for "Source".

- Fill the contents of `index.md` to your liking and it should just work.
